            Combined Resistors.

    <p>
        The spaceship's crew is in serious trouble now since the electronic circuit board for warp-speed-engine-control has blown and they're stalled in outher space.
    </p>

    <p>
        One resistor on the printed cicuit board has turned into a pile of smoking carbon but luckily someone found in the service documents what value it has to replace it with.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then, after hours searching thru the box with spare parts over and over, the horrified conclusion is that the requested resistor is not there !!!
    </p>

    <p>
        However maybe . . . will they be able to make a combination of resistors which then will serve as a replacement and save their souls?
    </p>

        Now it is up to you !

   Yyou have to write a piece of code: function "combine(box: tuple, requested: int) -> str" which is given:
</p>

<p>
the box of the available resistors (as a tuple) and the requested value (as a int) and returns a string describing the searched for combination.
</p>

<p>
The returned string shall be made up of functions describing how the contents of the box can be connected to achieve the reqested result (which may also represented by just a single number). The combination shall be made entirely of parallel and series connections (for simplicity so called "bridged circuitry" is not needed).
</p>

<p>
These two functions to do so are:
</p>

<pre class="brush: python">
"series(*a)" for series connections where "*a" is R1, R2, R3, ....      
"parallel(*a)" for parallel connections where "*a" is R1, R2, R3, ....
(A single resistor can be represented by its value alone.)
</pre>

<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>A few examples :</strong>
    </p>

<pre class="brush: python">
combine((3, 3, 6), 5) == "series(3, parallel(3, 6))"

combine((20, 20, 30, 30), 24) == "series(parallel(20, 30), parallel(20, 30))"
                              or "parallel(series(20, 20), series(30, 30))"

combine((12, 12, 12, 12), 3) == "parallel(12, 12, 12, 12)"
                             or "parallel(parallel(12, 12), parallel(12, 12))"

combine((24, 12), 12) == "12"   # (One single resistor.)

combine((6, 9), 12) == "None"   # (Oh no, can't be done!)
</pre>

<p>
<strong>The on the mission involved mathematics :</strong>
</p>

<p>
You can calculate the total resistance of two resistors (R1, R2) series connected (Rs) by:
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>
Rs = R1 + R2
</strong>
</p>

<p>
And the calculation for two resistors (R1, R2) parallel connected (Rp) is:
</p>

<p>
<strong>
Rp = 1 / (1 / R1 + 1 / R2)
</strong>
Which can also be written as :
<strong>
Rp = R1 * R2 / (R1 + R2)
</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>How it is used:</strong><br>
Electric circuitry.
