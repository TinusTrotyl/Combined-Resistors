You have to write a piece of code, a function "combine(list, number)" which is given:
&nbsp;<br />a list of the available resistors and the requested value and returns a string describing the combination searched for.
&nbsp;<br />The returned string shall be made up of functions describing how all is connected. The combination shall be made entirely of parallel and series connections (for simplicity "bridged circuitry" is not needed).
&nbsp;<br />These two functions to do so are:
