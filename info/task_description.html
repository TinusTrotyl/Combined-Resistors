<strong> Combined Resistors. </strong>
</h>
<p> The spaceship's crew is in serious trouble now since the electronic circuit board for warp-speed-engine-control has blown, they're stalled in outher space. A resistor on the cicuit board has turned into a pile of smoking carbon but luckily, someone found in the service documents what value it has to replace it with. </p>
<p> But after hours and hours searching thru the box with spare parts over and over, the horrified conclusion is that the requested resistor is not there. </p>
<p> However maybe . . . will they be able to make a combination of resistors which then will serve as a replacement and save their souls? </p>
<p> It is up to you now ! </p>

<strong> The Mission : </strong>
</h>
<p> You have to write a function `<strong>combine: </strong><strong>box, ohms &rarr;</strong><strong> combination`</strong></p>
<p> where `box` is a list of lists representing the box of spare parts, `ohms` the requested resistor and `combination` a list describing the wiring of the components in the folowing way : </p>
<p> Numbers in the combination list are series connected. Sub-lists however are parallel branches and can contain series connected components as well other sub-lists again.</p>
<p>Thus in each list: items are series and nested sub lists are parallel paths.</p>

<p><strong>A few examples:</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Fig.2: R1 and R2 parallel = [[1], [2]] </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Fig.3: R1 series (R2 parallel R3) = [1, [[2], [3]] </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;">Fig.4: (R1 series R2) parallel (R3 series R4) = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;">Fig.5: (R1 parallel R3) series (R2 parallel R4) = [[1], [3]], [[2], [4]]] </span></span></p>

<p> <strong>The on the mission involved mathematics :</strong> </p>
<p> You can calculate the total resistance of two resistors (R1, R2) series connected (Rs) by: </p>
<p> <strong> Rs = R1 + R2 </strong> </p>
<p> And the calculation for two resistors (R1, R2) parallel connected (Rp) is: </p>
<p> <strong> Rp = 1 / (1 / R1 + 1 / R2) </strong> Which can also be written as : <strong> Rp = R1 * R2 / (R1 + R2) </strong> </p>

<p> <strong>How it is used:</strong><br> Electric circuitry. </p>
