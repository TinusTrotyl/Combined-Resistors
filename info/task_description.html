            Combined Resistors.

    <p>
        The spaceship's crew is in serious trouble now since the electronic circuit board for warp-speed-engine-control has blown and they're stalled in outher space.
    </p>

    <p>
        One resistor on the printed cicuit board has turned into a pile of smoking carbon but luckily someone found in the service documents what value it has to replace it with.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then, after hours searching thru the box with spare parts over and over, the horrified conclusion is that the requested resistor is not there !!!
    </p>

    <p>
        However maybe . . . will they be able to make a combination of resistors which then will serve as a replacement and save their souls?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <p>
        Now it is up to you !

<p>You have to write a function `<strong>combine: </strong><strong>box, ohms &rarr;</strong><strong> combination`</strong></p>
<p>where `box` is a list of lists representing the box of spare parts, `ohms` the requested resistor and `combination` a list describing the wiring of the components.</p>
<p><Single numbers in the combination list are series connected. Sub-lists however are parallel forks of series connected components and parallel sub-lists again.</p>
<p>Thus in each list: items are series and nested sub lists are parallel branches.</p>

<p><strong>A few examples:</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;">R1 series R2 = [1, 2] (fig.1) </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;">R1 and R2 parallel = [[1], [2]] (fig.2)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;">R1 series (R2 parallel R3) = [1, [[2], [3]] (fig.3)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;">(R1 series R2) parallel (R3 series R4) = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] (fig.4)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><span style="font-size: small;">(R1 parallel R3) series (R2 parallel R4) = [[1], [3]], [[2], [4]]] (fig.5)</span></span></p>

<p>
<strong>The on the mission involved mathematics :</strong>
</p>

<p>
You can calculate the total resistance of two resistors (R1, R2) series connected (Rs) by:
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>
Rs = R1 + R2
</strong>
</p>

<p>
And the calculation for two resistors (R1, R2) parallel connected (Rp) is:
</p>

<p>
<strong>
Rp = 1 / (1 / R1 + 1 / R2)
</strong>
Which can also be written as :
<strong>
Rp = R1 * R2 / (R1 + R2)
</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>How it is used:</strong><br>
Electric circuitry.
