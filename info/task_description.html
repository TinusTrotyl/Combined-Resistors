    Combined Resistors
</h>

<p>
  The spaceship's crew is in serious trouble now since the electronic circuit board for warp-speed-engine-control has blown and they're stalled in outer space.
</p>

<p>
  One resistor on the printed cicuit board has turned into smoking carbon but luckily someone found in the service docs what value it has to replace it with.
</p>

<p>
  And then, after hours of searching the box with spare parts, the horrified conclusion is that the requested resistor is not there !!!
</p>

<p>
  However maybe . . . will they be able to make a combination of resistors as a replacement ?
